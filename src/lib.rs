//! The Quic Copier is an experimental high-performance remote file copy utility,
//! intended for long-distance internet connections.
//!
//! ## Overview
//! - üîß Drop-in replacement for `scp` or `rcp`
//! - üõ°Ô∏è Similar security to `scp`, using well-known and trustworthy mechanisms
//!   - User authentication uses `ssh` to establish a control channel and exchange TLS certificates. No PKI is necessary.
//!   - Data in transit is protected by TLS, with strict certificate checks in both directions
//! - üöÄ Better throughput on congested networks
//!   - Data is transported using the [QUIC](https://quicwg.github.io/) protocol over UDP
//!   - Tunable network properties
//!
//! ### Use case
//!
//! I was inspired to write this when I needed to copy a load of multi-GB files from a server on the other side of the planet.
//!
//! If you want to copy **large** files (tens of MB or more),
//! from _point to point_ over a _long, fat, congested pipe_,
//! then you may find it useful too.
//!
//! #### Limitations
//! - You must be able to ssh directly to the remote machine, and exchange UDP packets with it on a given port. (If the local machine is behind connection-tracking NAT, things work just fine. This is the case for the vast majority of home and business network connections.)
//! - Network security systems can't readily identify QUIC traffic as such. It's opaque, and high bandwidth. Some security systems might flag it as a potential threat.
//!
//! #### What qcp is not
//!
//! * A way to serve files to the public (Use http3.)
//! * A way to speed up downloads from sites you do not control (It's up to whoever runs those sites to install http3 or set up a [CDN].)
//! * Peer to peer file transfer (Use [BitTorrent]?)
//! * An improvement for interactive shells (Use [mosh].)
//! * Delta-based copying (Use [rsync].)
//!
//! ## How it works üìñ
//!
//! See [protocol].
//!
//! ## Getting the best out of qcp
//!
//! See [performance](doc::performance) and [troubleshooting](doc::troubleshooting).

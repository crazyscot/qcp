## Enables rustls debug messages. You still have to request them using the environment variable, e.g. `RUST_LOG="rustls=debug"`.
rustls-log = ["quinn/rustls-log"]
## Selects secure mode for memory allocations.
## This protects against various heap vulnerabilities, though comes at a performance cost.
## Extremely high bandwidth environments may wish to experiment with this for performance.

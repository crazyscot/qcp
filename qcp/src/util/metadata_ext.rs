            // When _creating_ a file, qcp client mode applies the user's umask.
            // (See `OpenOptionsExt::apply_qcp_meta.) Therefore, they will typically get mode 0644 or
            // 0664, which is OK. We have to assume that the destination user's umask is set
            // appropriately for their system policy.
            //
            // Then, if the user sets `--preserve`, they are explicitly instructing us to preserve permissions
            // as closely to the source as we can. If they do that, a read-write file on Windows becomes
            // a world-writeable file on Unix (mode 0666).
